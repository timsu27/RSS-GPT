Investors certainly know Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) as the media and entertainment powerhouse that owns popular cable networks including ABC, The Disney Channel, FX, and ESPN. The business also has a budding streaming division that is starting to report positive operating income.

But in fiscal 2024, 37% of the company's revenue came from the experiences segment, which encompasses Disney's theme parks, cruise ships, and consumer products. It's a key part of the flywheel that helps the brand connect with consumers across the globe.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

Management has announced a massive $60 billion investment, double the original plan, for the experiences division over the next decade. That's definitely a large sum of cash, but history says it's the right move that will pay off for the House of Mouse.

Bringing Disney's IP to the physical world

Disney's wide economic moat comes from its valuable intellectual property (IP), with its studios, franchises, and characters creating a treasure trove of content. The company's success is directly related to how it monetizes this IP. A lot of its money is made in movie theaters and on TV screens.

However, Disney's experiences segment brings this IP to life. The company owns two destinations in the U.S. and has a beneficial interest in four internationally. In total, it has 12 different theme parks. Seven of these are in the top 10 of the most popular by attendance. Combined, Disney sees 100 million visitors annually.

The company also rakes in revenue from its cruise ships and consumer products. Combined, this all makes up a very profitable segment, registering a superb 27% operating margin in fiscal 2024. That's better than entertainment and sports, the company's other two segments.

Doubling capex on experiences

Management wants to double capital expenditures to $60 billion over the next 10 years. That requires a huge cash outlay that will directly affect the company's ability to produce free cash flow.

Among the initiatives Disney plans are new attractions within the 1,000 acres of land that it hasn't yet developed across the world. A Pirates of the Caribbean Lounge is set to open this year, for example, with a Villains Land on the horizon later this decade. Expanding the cruise ship fleet is a huge priority. It just completed the Treasure, which set sail in November, with two new ships coming late in 2025. Between 2027 and 2031, four more ships will be built.

The cruise industry continues to see robust demand following the pandemic's disruptions. Disney not only wants to capitalize on this trend, but it also wants to use ships as a funnel to bring its IP to more fans. According to company research, there are 700 million people with "high Disney affinity" that have not visited a theme park, a huge untapped market opportunity.

This isn't the first Disney spending spree. At the start of the 2010s, the business directed more capital investments to parks and cruises. This resulted in much faster growth in operating income during that decade than in the previous decade. Executives aim to boost returns on invested capital, which will help its experiences segment create value for Disney.

Serving a larger customer base

This segment has historically been able to steadily raise prices, as evidenced by higher per-capita spending. That's certainly a wonderful quality to have.

There's a flip side to this, though. The last thing management wants to do is to keep raising prices to a point that they discourage families from visiting its theme parks or taking cruises. With that in mind, I believe the overarching goal is to expand capacity so that Disney can cater to more consumers. This can help increase the number of visitors instead of relying heavily on price hikes.

Investors should pay attention to commentary about specific investments being made and the returns that are achieved. Between fiscal 2014 and 2024, operating income for the experiences segment rose 132%. The hope is that Disney's planned $60 billion investment will result in that growth rate getting a boost.

<title>Is Wall Street Bullish or Bearish on Ross Stores Stock?</title>

<div> 。

關鍵詞: Ross Stores、零售業、股價表現、財報、分析師評級

<br /><br />總結:
1. Ross Stores是美國主要折扣零售商,市值478億美元,主營Ross Dress for Less和dd's DISCOUNTS兩個品牌,提供比百貨公司低20-70%的商品價格。

2. 過去52週股價表現不如大盤,SPX上漲20.8%時ROST略有下跌,今年至今下跌6.1%。

3. Q3總銷售51億美元低於預期,但每股收益1.48美元優於預期,毛利率擴大70個基點至28.3%,公司上調全年每股收益預期至6.10-6.17美元。

4. 分析師預計2025財年每股收益同比增長11%至6.17美元,過去四個季度均超預期。

5. 21位分析師中14位給予"強力買入"評級,7位給予"持有"評級,目標價171.63美元,最高目標價190美元較目前股價有32.7%上漲空間。 <div>
With a market cap of $47.8 billion , Ross Stores, Inc. ( ROST ) is a leading off-price retailer in the U.S., operating Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, which offer branded apparel, footwear, accessories, and home goods at 20% to 70% lower prices than department stores. Catering to middle- and moderate-income households, it focuses on providing quality fashion and home essentials at affordable prices.

Shares of the discount retailer have underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. ROST has dipped marginally over this time frame, while the broader S&amp;P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 20.8% . In addition, shares of ROST are down 6.1% on a YTD basis, compared to SPX’s 2.6% gain.

Focusing more closely, the Dublin, California-based company has also lagged behind the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s ( XLY ) 27.5% return over the past 52 weeks.

Despite reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 total sales of $5.1 billion on Nov. 21, shares of ROST rose 2.2% the next day due to stronger-than-expected EPS of $1.48. Investors were encouraged by the company's 70-basis-point gross margin expansion to 28.3%, driven by lower freight and supply-chain costs, which helped offset softer sales. Additionally, Ross Stores raised its full-year EPS forecast to $6.10 - $6.17.

For the fiscal year, which ended in January 2025, analysts expect ROST’s EPS to grow nearly 11% year-over-year to $6.17. However, the company's earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.

Among the 21 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 14 “Strong Buy” ratings and seven “Holds.”

This configuration is less bullish than three months ago, with 18 “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.

On Nov. 23, 2024, Baird cut Ross Stores' price target to $175 but kept an “Outperform” rating, citing an EPS beat despite weather-related comp sales weakness. The firm noted improving trends and viewed the Q4 guidance as a sign of management’s confidence.

As of writing, ROST is trading below the mean price target of $171.63. The Street-high price target of $190 implies a potential upside of 32.7% from the current price levels.

關鍵詞:Palantir, 人工智能, 股價上漲, 業務增長, 市值

<br /><br />總結:
1. Palantir股票去年漲幅超過380%,市值已達2600億美元,成為華爾街最熱門股票之一。

2. 分析師認為Palantir有望成為AI革命時代的"Windows",就像微軟在個人電腦時代的地位。

3. 該公司最新財報顯示強勁增長:客戶數同比增長43%,營收增長36%,美國市場增長52%,商業市場增長64%。

4. 作為AI軟件領域的領導者,Palantir具備長期增長潛力,可能在未來幾年繼續保持強勁表現。

5. 雖然股價已大幅上漲,但考慮到AI行業的發展前景,該股票仍可能有進一步上漲空間。 <div>
Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is probably the hottest stock on Wall Street. As of this writing, shares are up 51% year to date and more than 380% over the last 12 months.

So, where will Palantir shares be in one year? Let's dig into the numbers and see what's possible.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

A $260 billion market cap -- and counting

First things first, Palantir shares have been on an incredible ride.

Indeed, one year ago, I argued that "Palantir is a great company and a solid investment, [but] I don't think it has what it takes to cross the very high hurdle of $1 trillion by 2035."

When I wrote that, Palantir had a market capitalization of about $58 billion. As of this writing, it's over $260 billion -- and counting. That amounts to more than a fourfold return in less than one full year.

In other words, at that rate, Palantir would crack the $1 trillion mark in about one more year.

Needless to say, that seems overly optimistic, even for Palantir bulls like myself. Nevertheless, there's a reason why the company's stock has been skyrocketing: The company is on a path to something big.

Here's what it is.

Palantir could become the "Windows" of the AI revolution

Consider this: In the 1980s, personal computers were the great technological innovation. Almost everyone could see they were a big leap forward, but one question remained: Which operating system would emerge as the standard for the personal computer industry?

Apple had the Macintosh with its own proprietary operating system; many other companies offered their own systems with various bells and whistles.

Yet, one company ultimately came to dominate the space -- Microsoft, with its Windows operating system.

The lesson?

Artificial intelligence (AI) today could be analogous to personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the question is which company will develop the software that most elegantly harnesses the power of AI technology.

There will be plenty of winners. Sure, Microsoft won the first great battles in the personal computing wars, but others, like Apple, eventually recovered and delivered massive gains for its shareholders.

I believe Palantir could represent one of the first great AI software companies, a field which I expect to grow rapidly in the coming years. That's because AI -- along with robotics -- is poised to change the way organizations operate. Every aspect of operations, from logistics to customer service, even personnel management, can be improved with the aid of AI systems that will work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

As a result, expect more blowout earnings reports like the one Palantir just delivered.

For the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2024, the company reported:

A 43% growth in overall customers, year-over-year.

36% revenue growth from a year earlier, with 52% growth in the U.S. overall and 64% year-over-year growth in the U.S. commercial market

63% adjusted free cash flow margin.

In short, the company's financial metrics are surging, as you would expect from a leader within a cutting-edge field. Investors should pay attention. While Palantir's run thus far has been impressive, the stock could have legs for many years to come.

關鍵詞: 比特幣 以太坊 ETF SEC Bitwise

<br /><br />總結:
1. SEC於1月30日加速批准了Bitwise Asset Management的比特幣和以太坊混合ETF申請的初步部分。

2. 這個消息公布後,現有的比特幣和以太坊ETF吸引了約6.55億美元的新資金流入,表明機構投資者看好這個混合ETF可能推高兩種加密貨幣的價格。

3. 這個新的混合ETF將根據市值進行權重配置,因此會更接近比特幣的表現而非以太坊,這讓投資者可以在保持比特幣保守特性的同時,利用以太坊當前的相對低估值。

4. 文章提醒投資者不要過分期待新ETF會帶來驚人改變。從歷史數據來看,單一的比特幣和以太坊ETF的推出並未對價格產生顯著影響。

5. 建議投資者可以考慮適度增加對這兩種加密貨幣的投資,如投資1000美元,但前提是計劃持有至少幾年,以充分受益於ETF及類似產品帶來的資金流入。

6. 這個混合ETF的推出可能會帶動更多類似產品面世,這可能會對價格形成支撐,但投資者不應因此過度投資或期待價格暴漲。 <div>
It's boom time in the cryptocurrency sector. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) just picked up yet another reason that makes them worth a small investment of $1,000, even if you already hold some of each.

These two major coins just got exposure to an interesting new catalyst

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Jan. 30 approved the initial part of an application by Bitwise Asset Management to issue a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Bloomberg. The approval was granted on an expedited basis, and now it is highly likely that the final go-ahead will come soon, at which point it will start trading on the market.

Upon the announcement, the existing set of ETFs that hold either Bitcoin or Ethereum saw inflows of roughly $655 million in new cash, suggesting that there are institutional investors who see the combined ETF as a possibility that could send prices of both assets higher. How much higher is unclear, but this is a (new) contribution to the investment thesis for both coins.

The fact that Bitwise's prospective ETF seeks to offer a blended exposure to both coins at once means that it won't perform precisely like anything else that investors with traditional financial accounts typically have access to. Notably, the fund is weighted by the market caps of Bitcoin and Ethereum, so it will perform a lot more like Bitcoin than Ethereum. That's useful, because it means investors would be able to buy an asset that could, over the next three to five years, capitalize on the relative undervalue of Ethereum at its current price point without sacrificing most of the generally conservative attributes of an investment in Bitcoin.

Keep your estimates grounded here

As exciting as it is to see that there's a new financial instrument which might further integrate Bitcoin and Ethereum into the traditional financial sector, thereby drawing more outside cash into both coins, investors need to understand that the new ETF probably won't be a game changer. Nor does it need to be for these assets to be worth buying and holding for the long haul.

Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs have existed separately for a while. Here's a chart of the gains of these two coins during the past three years, for reference:

Can you guess based on the chart alone when the ETFs for these two coins started trading after their approval?

If you said early January 2024 for the first Bitcoin ETFs and late July 2024 for the first Ethereum ETFs, you'd be right -- but you'd probably only get it right if you already knew the answer. Simply put, ETF approvals and the commencement of trading are not definitive catalysts for the coins. Just look at the price graph for Ethereum after July.

In the event that the blended Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF gains popularity with investors, expect other ETF combinations to launch, too, which could support higher prices as well.

Nonetheless, don't get a second mortgage to invest more in Bitcoin or Ethereum because you expect their prices to go to the moon once the new ETF starts trading. The chance of that happening is close to nil. Instead, consider that this is a positive event that makes it worthwhile to up your exposure by a more modest amount, like $1,000, provided that you're planning to retain your tokens for at least a couple of years to capture the full benefit of any inflows to the ETF or others like it.

Should you invest $1,000 in Ethereum right now?

Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:

<div> 

Dividends, Investments, PepsiCo, Chevron, Rexford Industrial Realty

<br /><br />Summary:
1. The article discusses three companies that consistently provide high-yielding dividends and recently increased their payouts: PepsiCo, Chevron, and Rexford Industrial Realty.

2. PepsiCo offers a 3.8% dividend yield and announced a 5% increase, marking its 53rd consecutive annual increase. The company generated $12.5 billion in net cash last year, easily covering its $7.2 billion dividend payments.

3. Chevron increased its dividend by 5%, reaching its 38th consecutive year of increases. With a 4.2% yield, the company produced $15 billion in free cash flow last year and expects to add $10 billion to annual free cash flow by 2026.

4. Rexford Industrial Realty raised its dividend by 3%, offering a 4.1% yield. The REIT has grown its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since 2013 and expects over 30% growth in net operating income over the next three years.

5. All three companies demonstrate strong financial positions and sustainable dividend growth potential, making them attractive options for investors seeking reliable passive income streams.

6. The companies maintain strong balance sheets and show potential for continued dividend growth, positioning them as excellent long-term investment choices for income-focused investors. <div>
Some companies really treat their investors well. They pay lucrative dividends that they routinely raise. That makes them excellent stocks to buy and hold for passive income.

Several high-yielding dividend stocks recently raised their payouts again. That list includes PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Rexford Industrial Realty (NYSE: REXR). With more dividend growth likely, this trio are great stocks to buy and hold for a steadily rising stream of passive income.

Satisfying investors' thirst for dividend income

PepsiCo currently offers a dividend yield of around 3.8%. That's more than three times higher than the S&amp;P 500's dividend yield (around 1.2%).

The beverage and snacking giant recently announced its latest annual dividend increase. The company intends to increase its dividend by 5%, starting with the June payment. That represents its 53rd consecutive annual dividend increase, keeping PepsiCo in the elite group of Dividend Kings (companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend growth).

PepsiCo can easily afford its high-yielding and steadily growing dividend. The company produced $12.5 billion in net cash last year, easily covering its $7.2 billion dividend outlay. PepsiCo also repurchased $1 billion of its shares. The company ended the year with a cash-rich balance sheet with over $9 billion of cash and short-term investments. With more growth ahead (it expects to deliver mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth in 2025), PepsiCo is in a strong position to continue paying a growing dividend.

A well-oiled dividend-paying machine

Chevron recently announced a 5% dividend increase for 2025. That marks the oil giant's 38th consecutive year with an annual dividend increase. It has grown its payout at a faster pace than the S&amp;P 500 has over the past five years. That pace is nearly double the rate of its nearest peer in the oil patch. With its latest raise, Chevron's dividend yields 4.2%.

The oil giant is in an excellent position to continue increasing its dividend. It produced $15 billion in free cash flow last year, easily covering its $11.8 billion dividend outlay. Chevron returned a record $27 billion in cash to shareholders last year via dividends and share repurchases by utilizing its strong balance sheet. It ended the year with a net debt ratio of around 10%, well below its 20% to 25% target range.

Chevron expects to produce an even bigger free cash flow gusher in the future. It foresees adding $10 billion to its annual free cash flow by 2026, fueled by projects to grow its high-margin production and cost savings initiatives. That number doesn't include its pending acquisition of Hess, which would significantly enhance and extend its free cash flow growth outlook. It should give the oil giant plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout.

Lots of built-in growth

Rexford Industrial Realty recently revealed that it's raising its dividend by another 3%. That pay bump pushed the industrial real estate investment trust's (REIT's) dividend yield up to around 4.1%.

On the one hand, Rexford's recent raise is a bit light compared to its historical growth rate. The REIT has grown its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since its initial public offering in 2013. It could certainly have supported a higher dividend increase, given its strong financial profile and the earnings growth it delivered last year (6.8% increase in its core funds from operations (FFO) per share).

Instead, the REIT opted to launch a $300 million share repurchase program to capitalize on the nearly 30% decline in its share price since the start of last year. The company's stock has slumped due to higher interest rates and slowing demand growth in the Southern California logistics market, its sole focus area.

Rexford Industrial has significant built-in growth that should help offset the near-term headwinds of the Southern California warehouse market. The company expects its net operating income to grow by more than 30% over the next three years, driven by repositioning and redevelopment projects and rental increases (embedded in its existing leases and capturing much higher market rates as legacy leases expire).

On top of that, the REIT has a strong balance sheet, giving it ample financial flexibility to make accretive acquisitions as opportunities arise. The REIT's built-in growth and additional upside from acquisitions and improving market conditions position it to continue increasing its dividend in the future.

High-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks

PepsiCo, Chevron, and Rexford Industrial Realty continue to grow their high-yielding dividends. They're all in strong positions to keep pushing their payouts higher in the future. Because of that, they're excellent dividend stocks for those seeking lucrative and growing income streams to buy.

Some companies really treat their investors well. They pay lucrative dividends that they routinely raise. That makes them excellent stocks to buy and hold for passive income.

Several high-yielding dividend stocks recently raised their payouts again. That list includes PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Rexford Industrial Realty (NYSE: REXR). With more dividend growth likely, this trio are great stocks to buy and hold for a steadily rising stream of passive income.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

Satisfying investors' thirst for dividend income

PepsiCo currently offers a dividend yield of around 3.8%. That's more than three times higher than the S&amp;P 500's dividend yield (around 1.2%).

The beverage and snacking giant recently announced its latest annual dividend increase. The company intends to increase its dividend by 5%, starting with the June payment. That represents its 53rd consecutive annual dividend increase, keeping PepsiCo in the elite group of Dividend Kings (companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend growth).

PepsiCo can easily afford its high-yielding and steadily growing dividend. The company produced $12.5 billion in net cash last year, easily covering its $7.2 billion dividend outlay. PepsiCo also repurchased $1 billion of its shares. The company ended the year with a cash-rich balance sheet with over $9 billion of cash and short-term investments. With more growth ahead (it expects to deliver mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth in 2025), PepsiCo is in a strong position to continue paying a growing dividend.

A well-oiled dividend-paying machine

Chevron recently announced a 5% dividend increase for 2025. That marks the oil giant's 38th consecutive year with an annual dividend increase. It has grown its payout at a faster pace than the S&amp;P 500 has over the past five years. That pace is nearly double the rate of its nearest peer in the oil patch. With its latest raise, Chevron's dividend yields 4.2%.

The oil giant is in an excellent position to continue increasing its dividend. It produced $15 billion in free cash flow last year, easily covering its $11.8 billion dividend outlay. Chevron returned a record $27 billion in cash to shareholders last year via dividends and share repurchases by utilizing its strong balance sheet. It ended the year with a net debt ratio of around 10%, well below its 20% to 25% target range.

Chevron expects to produce an even bigger free cash flow gusher in the future. It foresees adding $10 billion to its annual free cash flow by 2026, fueled by projects to grow its high-margin production and cost savings initiatives. That number doesn't include its pending acquisition of Hess, which would significantly enhance and extend its free cash flow growth outlook. It should give the oil giant plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout.

Lots of built-in growth

Rexford Industrial Realty recently revealed that it's raising its dividend by another 3%. That pay bump pushed the industrial real estate investment trust's (REIT's) dividend yield up to around 4.1%.

On the one hand, Rexford's recent raise is a bit light compared to its historical growth rate. The REIT has grown its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since its initial public offering in 2013. It could certainly have supported a higher dividend increase, given its strong financial profile and the earnings growth it delivered last year (6.8% increase in its core funds from operations (FFO) per share).

Instead, the REIT opted to launch a $300 million share repurchase program to capitalize on the nearly 30% decline in its share price since the start of last year. The company's stock has slumped due to higher interest rates and slowing demand growth in the Southern California logistics market, its sole focus area.

Rexford Industrial has significant built-in growth that should help offset the near-term headwinds of the Southern California warehouse market. The company expects its net operating income to grow by more than 30% over the next three years, driven by repositioning and redevelopment projects and rental increases (embedded in its existing leases and capturing much higher market rates as legacy leases expire).

On top of that, the REIT has a strong balance sheet, giving it ample financial flexibility to make accretive acquisitions as opportunities arise. The REIT's built-in growth and additional upside from acquisitions and improving market conditions position it to continue increasing its dividend in the future.

High-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks

PepsiCo, Chevron, and Rexford Industrial Realty continue to grow their high-yielding dividends. They're all in strong positions to keep pushing their payouts higher in the future. Because of that, they're excellent dividend stocks for those seeking lucrative and growing income streams to buy.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $336,677 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,109 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $546,804!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.
