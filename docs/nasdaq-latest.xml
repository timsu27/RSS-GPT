關鍵詞: 原油價格、OPEC+、美國制裁、原油供應、原油需求

<br /><br />總結:
1. 週五WTI原油和汽油價格溫和上漲,主要受美國就業數據改善推動。
2. OPEC+維持第一季度產量不變,計劃從4月開始逐步恢復產量。
3. 美國加強對伊朗原油出口制裁,針對其向中國運輸原油的國際網絡。
4. 全球油輪原油庫存下降6.9%,俄羅斯原油出口也減少,支撐油價。
5. 中國作為全球最大原油進口國,2024年進口量同比下降1.9%,對油價構成壓力。
6. 美國原油產量略低於12月創下的紀錄高位,活躍鑽井數量比2022年12月的高點有所下降。 <div>
March WTI crude oil (CLH25) Friday closed up +0.39 (+0.55%), and March RBOB gasoline (RBH25) closed up +0.0303 (+1.46%).

Crude oil and gasoline prices Friday posted moderate gains on signs of US economic strength after the Jan unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to an 8-month low of 4.0%. Also, concerns that global crude supplies could tighten are boosting prices after the US ramped up sanctions on Iranian crude exports on Thursday. A stronger dollar Friday limited the upside in crude oil. Also, the unexpected decline in the University of Michigan US Feb consumer sentiment index to a 7-month low is bearish for energy demand and crude prices.

The strength of the crude crack spread is bullish for crude prices after the crack spread rose to a 5-3/4 month high on Friday. The higher crack spread encourages refiners to boost their crude purchases and refine the crude into gasoline and distillates.

Crude also has support after the US ramped up sanctions on Iranian crude exports when the US Treasury on Thursday sanctioned an international network for facilitating the shipment of Iranian crude oil to China.

A decline in crude oil held worldwide on tankers is bullish for oil prices. Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least seven days fell by -6.9% w/w to 67.30 million bbl in the week ended January 31.

OPEC+ said Monday at its monthly meeting that it would not change its oil-production plans in the first quarter and then gradually restore crude output in monthly stages beginning in April.

Crude prices saw support on January 10 when the US imposed new sanctions on Russia's oil industry that could curb global oil supplies. The measures targeted Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftgas, which exported about 970,000 bpd of Russian crude in the first 10 months of 2024, accounting for about 30% of its tanker flow, according to Bloomberg data. The US also targeted insurers and traders linked to hundreds of tanker cargoes.

A decline in Russian crude oil exports is supportive of crude oil prices. Weekly vessel-tracking data from Bloomberg showed Russian crude exports fell by -130,000 bpd to 3.09 million bpd in the week to February 2.

The outlook for new sanctions on Iranian and Russian crude exports could limit global oil supplies and is bullish for prices. President Trump's national security adviser, Mike Walz, vowed a return to "maximum pressure" on Iran. Also, US Treasury Secretary Bessent said he would be "100% on board for taking sanctions up," especially on Russian oil majors to ramp up pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

Crude found support last month after OPEC+ pushed back a planned hike of its crude production by +180,000 bpd from January to April and said it would unwind its crude output cuts at a slower pace than planned. Also, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said it will delay the planned 300,000 bpd increase in its crude production target from January to April. OPEC+ had previously agreed to restore 2.2 million bpd of output in monthly installments between January and late 2025. However, that is now pushed back until September 2026. OPEC Jan crude production fell -700,000 bpd to 27.03 million bpd.

Crude oil demand in China has weakened and is a bearish factor for oil prices. According to Chinese customs data, China's 2024 crude imports fell -1.9% y/y to 553 MMT. China is the world's biggest crude importer.

Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of January 31 were -3.8% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were +0.3% above the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -12.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending January 31 rose +1.8% w/w to 13.478 million bpd, modestly below the record high of 13.631 million bpd from the week of December 6.

Baker Hughes reported Friday that active US oil rigs in the week ending February 7 rose by +1 to 480 rigs, modesty above the 3-year low of 472 rigs posted January 24. The number of US oil rigs has fallen over the past two years from the 4-1/2 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.

February is the shortest month, but that doesn't mean income investors don't have much time to find great stocks. Three Motley Fool contributors believe they have identified fabulous dividend stocks to buy this month. Here's why they like AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD).

Resurging dividend royalty

Keith Speights (AbbVie): AbbVie has been a longtime favorite for income investors. The big drugmaker's 52 consecutive years of dividend increases (including when it was part of Abbott) qualify it as a Dividend King. Its forward dividend yield is a juicy 3.4%.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

For a while, though, AbbVie might not have been viewed as a fabulous pick by many investors. Humira, the company's top-selling drug for years, lost U.S. patent exclusivity in early 2023. As a result, revenue and profits began to sink.

However, it's a much different story today. Business is booming for Humira's two successors, Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The two drugs generated combined sales in 2024 that eclipsed Humira's peak annual sales. AbbVie projects they'll generate sales of over $31 billion in 2027.

The drugmaker has other important growth drivers, too. Qulipta and Ubrelvy especially stand out, with sales for the two migraine therapies skyrocketing 76% and 30% year over year, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2024.

AbbVie's pipeline also looks promising. The company has over 50 programs in mid- or late-stage clinical development. Tavapadon is one candidate to watch in the near term. It recently reported positive late-stage results for the drug in treating early Parkinson's disease.

Look past the recent clinical setback

Prosper Junior Bakiny (Amgen): What to do when a biotech's shares fall off a cliff following disappointing phase 2 clinical trial results? If the drugmaker's prospects are largely unaffected, it's a good opportunity to buy the stock.

That brings us to Amgen. In November, it reported mid-stage clinical trial results for MariTide, an investigational weight loss treatment, and the market responded by sending the stock down more than 12%.

Though Amgen has recouped much of that loss, the stock is still down over the trailing-12-month period. Long-term income seekers should take the opportunity to buy its shares since its prospects and dividend program remain robust.

The company's lineup features 13 products that generate over $1 billion in sales. Many of them are still growth drivers, including Repatha, to treat high cholesterol; postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment Evenity; and Tepezza, for thyroid eye disease.

Amgen has several other drugs that don't bring in $1 billion in annual sales yet but should soon, especially Tezspire, which treats asthma.

The drugmaker's pipeline is still pretty deep and features several dozen programs. Despite MariTide not quite living up to expectations in mid-stage clinical trials, it could still go on to become successful in the weight loss and obesity markets.

Lastly, Amgen has increased its payouts by 201% in the past decade and offers a forward yield of 3.3%, compared to the S&amp;P 500's average of about 1.3%. It may have lagged the market over the past year, but the stock is still an excellent option for dividend seekers.

Gilead is a steady dividend stock with a high, growing payout

David Jagielski (Gilead Sciences): Biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences can make for a terrific dividend stock to buy and hold right now. It yields 3.2%, which is more than twice the S&amp;P 500 average.

The company has also been growing its dividend. In five years, Gilead's quarterly payout has risen from $0.63 to $0.77 per share -- that's an increase of 22%. For investors, it can be crucial to find a company that is likely to increase its payouts because that can help offset the effects of inflation.

Gilead's business also generates plenty of free cash flow, which not only can support the current dividend but also pave the way for more increases to the payout in the future. In the trailing 12 months, the company has generated free cash flow totaling $9.4 billion -- far more than the $3.9 billion in dividends it paid out during that time frame.

Another reason dividend investors will love Gilead is for the stability the stock offers. It has a low beta value of around 0.20, which means that the stock generally doesn't move along with the market. But despite this, it has still made for an excellent investment, rising by more than 50% in the past five years.

Gilead has a robust business that centers around HIV drugs. But the company has also been pursuing growth opportunities in treating liver disease and cancer, which make this a much more diversified investment overall. It may not be a fast-growing pharma stock, but with solid fundamentals and a great dividend, it can be an ideal investment for income seekers to load up on today.

Should you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?

Before you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and AbbVie wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $795,728!*

Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of S&amp;P 500 since 2002*.

<title>How To Make Your Tax Refund Stretch Throughout the Entire Year (And Beyond)</title>

Receiving a tax refund is one of the most anticipated events of the financial year. It is an opportunity to strengthen one’s financial future.

Try This: 3 Sneaky Things You Didn’t Realize Your Tax Software Was Doing — And How to Stop Them This Year

Instead of spending it all at once, here is how to make your tax refund stretch throughout the entire year and beyond.

Address Immediate Needs

Many people use their tax refunds to pay down debt or rebuild savings, but with the right strategies, they can last throughout the year — or even longer.

“By addressing immediate needs such as paying off high-interest debt, cover overdue bills or replenish depleted savings,” said Moira Corcoran, a certified public accountant (CPA) and Just Answer Tax Expert. “Paying off high-interest debt like credit cards saves you interest and frees up cash flow for other expenses.”

Janelle Sallenave, the chief spending officer at Chime, said individuals should start paying off credit cards with rates over 16%.

“If you prefer a smaller and more manageable start, try the debt snowball method,” Sallenave said. “By doing this, you’ll pay off your smallest debt first, then move your way up, directing extra money toward each balance as you go.”

Invest Your Refund

Whether individuals use their tax refund to contribute to an employer-sponsored 401(k) or individual retirement account (IRA), adding money to these accounts early allows taxpayers to benefit from compound interest.

“If you aren’t already contributing or maxing-out, adding to your retirement fund now can help you secure your financial future and boost your overall savings,” Sallenave said.

A high-yield savings account can help individuals invest their tax refund without risking loss.

“These accounts are federally insured (usually up to $250,000) and typically have a higher interest rate than a standard savings account,” said Leslie H. Tanye, Esq., a finance and debt expert and founder of Tanye Law Group. “I recommend shopping for a high-yield savings account with an annual percentage yield (APY) of at least 5%.”

Individuals could also invest in a treasury, which entails loaning money to the government with the promise of being repaid with interest.

“These investments vary in maturity, with treasury bills typically maturing one year (but can be sooner), and treasury bonds maturing after 20 to 30 years,” Tanye said.

Upskill

According to the Associated Press, professional and business services companies scaled back their job postings in recent months. A tax refund can also be a valuable tool for investing in your professional growth.

“Use it to take a course to learn a new skill or even earn a certificate in a select field,” Sallenave said. “Whether it’s preparing for a promotion or transitioning to a new career, these investments can lead to a higher salary in the future, making your refund even more valuable over time.”

Start An Emergency Fund

Use the tax refund to start an emergency fund.

“Then set up an automatic transfer to add funds to this account until the balance represents three to six months’ of living experiences,” said Pam Ladd, a certified public accountant (CPA) and senior manager of personal financial planning) at the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).

Avoid ‘Early Refund’ Offers

According to the IRS, the average tax refund is $3,050, which could make a huge difference for financially vulnerable households, said Nick Maynard, senior vice president at Commonwealth.

“It’s hard to overstate how big a financial event this is for many low-to-moderate income households,” Maynard said. “At the household level, the federal tax refund is often the largest lump sum of many families receive all year, amounting to as much as 20% of annual household income.”

Maynard said that while a tax refund could be a financial windfall for some households, one way to stretch the money throughout the year is to avoid “early refund” offers, which often come with a fee.

“Typically, the IRS issues a refund within three weeks of electronic filing,” Maynard said. “Having a plan in place before receiving a fund can help you assign these dollars to good use.”

Losing your home unexpectedly, whether due to natural disaster, foreclosure or eviction, can be overwhelming. While the emotional toll is significant, taking immediate financial steps can help you regain stability and plan for the future.

Here are nine financial things to do if you unexpectedly lose your house.

Assess Your Immediate Financial Situation

Take a close look at the current state of your finances. Check your bank balances, credit card limits, and any savings or emergency funds you have.

Understanding your financial standing will help you make better, more informed decisions.

Check for Insurance Coverage

If a natural disaster, fire or another covered event caused your housing loss, contact your homeowners or renters insurance provider to file a claim.

This could provide immediate financial relief for temporary housing and essential expenses.

Seek Temporary Housing Assistance

Look into emergency housing options, such as government programs, nonprofit organizations and short-term rental solutions. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), local shelters and community programs can provide support, depending on your situation.

FEMA, for example, has programs to support individuals and households affected by natural disaster, provide legal services, and offer unemployment assistance. And according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, there are local programs that can offer housing assistance.

Explore Government and Community Aid

Programs such as emergency rental assistance, nutrition assistance and unemployment benefits may be available depending on your circumstances.

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program can offer support for paying utility bills, for example.

Reach out to local and federal agencies to know what’s available for potential financial support.

Prioritize Essential Expenses

Focus on necessities like food, transportation, healthcare and securing a new place to stay. Cut unnecessary expenses and redirect funds toward immediate needs.

Evaluate Your Credit Standing

Losing your home can affect your credit score, especially if it involved missed mortgage or rent payments. Check your credit report for accuracy and start working on rebuilding your credit if necessary.

If a home is lost in a natural disaster, Equifax recommends contacting credit card companies to explain the situation. In some cases, they have forbearance programs that may be able to help.

Rebuild Your Financial Safety Net

Once you have stabilized your immediate needs, start working on rebuilding an emergency fund. Most experts recommend three to six months’ worth of savings, but start where you can.

Even small, consistent savings can help prevent future financial crises.

Seek Legal and Financial Advice

Depending on how you lost your home, a financial advisor or legal expert can help you navigate next steps, such as negotiating debts or applying for assistance.

關鍵詞:百萬富翁 收藏車款 投資 升值 古董車

<br /><br />總結:
1. Hagerty(古董車服務公司)每年發布收藏車升值潛力排名,反映百萬富翁的投資選擇。

2. 1961-1964年的Jaguar E-Type價格在18-26萬美元,為富人青睞的投資標的。

3. 2003-2013 Lamborghini Gallardo因其相對親民的價格(15-20萬美元)吸引較年輕的X世代買家。

4. 1989 Lamborghini Countach Anniversary為最熱門車款,價值在61-77萬美元之間,極品車款可達166萬美元。

5. 2014 Ferrari FF因其實用性受到年輕富豪歡迎,價格約14-17萬美元,顯示新一代富人更注重實用性。 <div>
Record-breaking, multimillion-dollar auctions at Barrett-Jackson and Sotheby’s dominate the headlines in the collector car world — but what makes and models do millionaires invest in as portfolio hedges instead of as hobbies or trophies? While the monied class is notoriously vigilant about financial privacy, data from Hagerty sheds light on the subject.

The collector car services company — which provides niche-specific auto insurance and runs a collector vehicle marketplace and auction house — publishes an annual Bull Market List of the rare and coveted cars appreciating the fastest as high-end buyers spur demand. Hagerty’s ratings include factors like import/export numbers, public auction data, owner demographics and price guide research.

A look at the data from the last two years reveals which collector cars millionaires are buying as investments instead of status symbols.

1961-1964 Jaguar E-Type

Some of the most iconic cars on the Hagerty list are comparatively affordable. For example, the 2025 ranking shows investors scooping up 1981-83 DeLorean DMC-12s — but they’re paying an average of just $34,500 for a time machine in fair condition. That’s $463 more than the $34,037 the average sneaker aficionado pays for reproductions of Michael J. Fox/Marty McFly’s self-lacing Nike Mags from “Back to the Future Part II.”

On the other hand, Jaguar E-Types from the early ’60s are available only to the wealthy — and the wealthy are snapping them up. Those on the pricier half of the value spectrum go for $182,800 to $262,000.

2003-2013 Lamborghini Gallardo

Also on the 2025 list of this year’s hottest cars are Lambo Gallardos from the decade starting in 2003.

Millionaires are paying $157,700 to $206,400 for those on the better half of the value scale — and 84% of interest in the rear-engine V-10 supercar comes from Gen X buyers or younger. Only 14,000 were ever made, but since other Lamborghinis are appreciating faster, the Gallardo is a relative bargain for younger auto investors whose deep pockets might be shallower than their baby boomer parents.

1989 Lamborghini Countach Anniversary

In 1974, Lamborghini unveiled the Countach, which would go on to define ’80s flash and achieve popular culture superstar status — it remains the most iconic supercar ever built. In 1989, the celebrated Italian nameplate released what Hagerty argues was history’s finest Countach to celebrate the founding of Automobili Lamborghini in 1963.

In 2024, wealthy investors made the 1989 Lamborghini Countach Anniversary the hottest collector car on the Hagerty roundup. Although only around 650 examples were ever produced, that’s still a lot by Lambo standards. Those on the better half of the value spectrum — many of which roared with upgraded V-12s — went for between $612,500 and $770,000 when wealthy investors forced their rapid appreciation last year, making models like the Gallardo more attainable in 2025.

However, you can spend much more on remarkably pristine or famous examples. For instance, in 2024, Sotheby’s announced that the 1989 Anniversary V-12 Lamborghini seen in 2013’s “The Wolf of Wall Street” fetched $1.66 million at auction.

2014 Ferrari FF

Investors from Gen X and younger generations also bought the lion’s share of the 2014 Ferrari FFs that earned the model a spot on the 2024 Hagerty list — but for different reasons than the Lamborghini Gallardo. Younger sets saw the Gallardo as a bargain when models like the Countach Anniversary started appreciating too quickly, but they flocked to the FF because it has room for car seats in the back.

Unlike their wealthier baby boomer parents, millionaire Gen Xers, millennials and even some Gen Zers are investing in Ferrari FFs because they’re among the most utilitarian ultra-luxury vehicles money can buy — but buying does require a lot of money. The Ferrari FFs on the more desirable half of the value range go for $143,000 to $177,000.

<div> 和之後。

關鍵詞:博彩娛樂、市值下跌、業績虧損、分析師評級、股價目標

<br /><br />總結:
1. Caesars Entertainment是總部位於內華達州里諾的博彩娛樂公司,市值77億美元,在北美18個州經營賭場和度假村。

2. 公司股價表現不佳,過去52週下跌17%,遠遜於標普500指數上漲21%,但今年至今上漲6.9%。

3. 第三季度業績令人失望,每股虧損0.04美元,收入29億美元低於預期,區域業務收入下降7.6%,拉斯維加斯收入下跌1.3%。

4. 分析師預計2024財年每股虧損0.64美元,過去四個季度均未達到盈利預期。

5. 15位分析師中,11位給予"強力買入"評級,目標價48.80美元,最高目標價58美元較現價有62.3%上漲空間。 <div>
With a market cap of $7.7 billion , Reno, Nevada-based Caesars Entertainment, Inc. ( CZR ) is a leading gaming and hospitality company operating casinos, resorts, and entertainment venues across North America and beyond. With properties in 18 states, it offers a diverse range of gaming options, including slot machines, table games, online gaming, and sports betting.

Shares of the casino and resort operator have underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. CZR has dipped 17% over this time frame, while the broader S&amp;P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 21% . However, shares of CZR are up 6.9% on a YTD basis, outperforming SPX’s 1.9% gain.

Focusing more closely, CZR has also lagged behind the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s ( XLY ) 27.6% return over the past 52 weeks.

Shares of CZR tumbled 8.2% following its disappointing Q3 earnings release on Oct. 29. The company reported an adjusted loss of $0.04 per share and net revenue of $2.9 billion, both lagged the consensus estimate. The Regional segment’s revenues dropped 7.6% year over year to $1.5 billion, impacted by new competition, construction disruptions, and inclement weather, while Las Vegas revenues fell 1.3% to $1.1 billion due to weaker gaming volumes after the Rio divestiture.

For fiscal 2024, which ended in December, analysts expect CZR to report a loss of $0.64 per share , indicating a significant year-over-year decline. The company's earnings surprise history is unfavorable. It missed the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.

Among the 15 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 11 “Strong Buy” ratings, three “Holds,” and one “Strong Sell.”

On Nov. 26, 2024, JMP Securities lowered Caesars' price target to $57 while maintaining an “Outperform” rating. The firm cited stable gaming trends in Louisiana and Mississippi but noted challenges in passing an iGaming bill, despite potential gubernatorial support.

As of writing, Caesars Entertainment is trading below the mean price target of $48.80. The Street-high price target of $58 implies a potential upside of 62.3% from the current price levels.

The S&amp;P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) Friday closed down -0.95%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down -0.99%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed down -1.30%. March E-mini S&amp;P futures (ESH25) fell by -0.90%, and March E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQH25) fell by -1.30%.

Stock indexes on Friday gave up early gains and turned lower after the University of Michigan US Feb consumer sentiment index unexpectedly fell to a 7-month low and the University of Michigan US Feb inflation expectations unexpectedly increased. Also, higher bond yields Friday weighed on stocks. Bond yields rose Friday after the US Jan unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to an 8-month low, and Jan average hourly earnings rose more than expected, hawkish factors for Fed policy. The higher bond yields sparked a slide in chip makers and homebuilding stocks.

Losses in stock indexes accelerated Friday afternoon after President Trump said he will unveil reciprocal tariffs on "everyone" next week to ensure the US is treated evenly with other countries, without specifying nations involved.

Corporate earnings results on Friday were mixed. Amazon.com closed down more than -4% after giving an outlook that was weaker than expected. Also, Microchip Technology closed down more than -2% after forecasting Q4 net sales below consensus. On the positive side, Expedia Group closed up more than +17% after reporting Q4 earnings well above consensus. Also, Take-Two Interactive Software closed up more than +14% after forecasting full-year adjusted Ebitda above consensus and reiterating its plan to launch Grand Theft Auto VI in the fall of 2025.

US Jan nonfarm payrolls rose +143,000, weaker than expectations of +175,000, but Dec was revised upward to +307,000 from the previously reported +256,000. The Jan unemployment rate unexpectedly fell -0.1 to an 8-month low of 4.0%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of no change at 4.1%.

US Jan average hourly earnings rose +0.5% m/m and +4.1% y/y, stronger than expectations of +0.3% m/m and +3.8% y/y.

The University of Michigan US Feb consumer sentiment index unexpectedly fell -3.3 to a 7-month low of 67.8, weaker than expectations of an increase to 71.8.

The University of Michigan US Feb 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly jumped to a 15-month high of 4.3% versus expectations of no change at 3.3%. Also, the Feb 5-10 inflation expectations unexpectedly increased to a 16-year high of 3.3%, stronger than expectations of no change at 3.2%.

US Dec consumer credit surged a record +$40.847 billion, stronger than expectations of +$15.45 billion.

Fed comments were mixed for stocks. Thursday evening, Dallas Fed President Logan said interest rates might already be near a neutral level, potentially obviating the need for further Fed rate cuts even if inflation continues to cool. Conversely, Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari said Friday he expects inflation will continue to cool toward the Fed's 2% target, allowing policymakers to lower interest rates "modestly" by the end of the year.

Earnings season is in full swing as companies report Q4 earnings results. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, analysts estimate S&amp;P 500 earnings grew by +7.5% y/y in Q4, the second-highest pre-season forecast in the past three years.

The markets are discounting the chances at 10% for a -25 bp rate cut at the next FOMC meeting on March 18-19.

Overseas stock markets on Friday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed down -0.58%. China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed to a 5-week high and closed up +1.01%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.72%.

Interest Rates

March 10-year T-notes (ZNH25) Friday closed down by -11 ticks. The 10-year T-note yield rose by +4.9 bp to 4.483%. March T-notes Friday whipsawed to a 1-1/2 month high and then retreated, and the 10-year T-note yield rebounded from a 1-1/2 month low of 4.380% and moved higher. T-notes initially spiked higher Friday on the smaller-than-expected increase in US Jan nonfarm payrolls but reversed and sold off after the Jan unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to an 8-month low and Jan average hourly earnings rose more than expected, hawkish factors for Fed policy. T-note losses accelerated Friday after the University of Michigan US Feb inflation expectations unexpectedly increased.

T-notes recovered from their worst levels Friday after a slump in stock boosted safe-haven demand for government debt. Also, dovish comments from Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari Hawkish were supportive of T-notes when he said slowing inflation would allow policymakers to lower interest rates "modestly" by the end of the year.

European government bond yields on Friday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell -0.7 bp to 2.372%. The 10-year UK gilt yield fell -0.8 bp to 4.476%.

German Dec industrial production fell -2.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.7% m/m and the biggest decline in 5 months.

German trade news was better than expected as Dec exports unexpectedly rose +2.9% m/m, stronger than expectations of a -0.5% m/m decline and the biggest increase in 11 months. Also, Dec imports rose +2.1% m/m, stronger than expectations of +1.9% m/m and the biggest increase in 5 months.

Swaps are discounting the chances at 100% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the March 6 policy meeting.

US Stock Movers

Amazon.com (AMZN) closed down more than -4% after forecasting Q1 net sales of $151.0 billion-$155.5 billion, weaker than the consensus of $158.64 billion.

Homebuilding stocks retreated Friday on the jump in T-note yields and slide in US consumer sentiment, bearish factors for housing demand. As a result, Toll Brothers (TOL) closed down more than -6%, and DR Horton (DHI) closed down more than -5%. Also, KB Home (KBH) and Lennar (LEN) closed down more than -4%, and PulteGroup (PHM) closed down more than -3%.

Higher T-note yields on Friday weighed on chip stocks. Marvell Technology (MRVL) closed down more than -7% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100. Also, ARM Holdings Plc (ARM), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and ON Semiconductor (ON) closed down more than -2%. In addition, Applied Materials (AMAT), Intel (INTC), KLA Corp (KLAC), NXP Semiconductor NV (NXPI), GlobalFoundries (GFS), and Texas Instruments (TXN) closed down more than -1%.

Air Products & Chemicals (APD) closed down more than -5% after JPMorgan Chase downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight.

Elf Beauty (ELF) closed down more than -19% after reporting Q3 adjusted EPS of 74 cents, below the consensus of 77 cents, and cut its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to $3.27-$3.32 from a previous forecast of $3.47-$3.53, well below the consensus of $3.61. Also, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) closed down more than -6% on the news to lead losers in the S&amp;P 500.

Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) closed up more than +8% after reporting Q4 revenue of $621.7 million, stronger than the consensus of $608.1 million, and forecast Q1 revenue of $610.0 million-$630.0 million, well above the consensus of $582.8 million.

Disney (NYSE: DIS) released fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday morning, and the market responded with a loud "meh." After opening up with a brief pop, the stock quickly fell and was trading down about 1% for most of the session.

Few other companies have so many evident competitive advantages yet have struggled so much on the stock market, as the stock has been basically flat over the last decade.

Some investors believe Disney is finally turning the corner after several years of underwhelming returns. After all, its streaming business is now profitable, and it fully owns Hulu. It's also set to launch the flagship ESPN streaming service in the fall.

There's certainly potential in the stock given its bevy of assets and the recent performance of streaming leader Netflix, which shows that the streaming market may be even bigger than investors had believed.

However, there are three things Disney needs to demonstrate before it's convincingly on a path to growth.

1. It needs to grow its streaming audience

Disney has succeeded in turning its streaming business profitable, but growth is still an issue. In a quarter when Netflix added nearly 20 million subscribers to its streaming service, Disney lost 700,000 on Disney+ and added 1.6 million on Hulu, a net gain of 900,000. It also raised prices, so streaming revenue was up during the quarter even though subscriber growth was minimal.

Disney's record over the last year is more impressive as it added 13.3 million subscribers to Disney+ over the last four quarters, though that number may have been boosted by the new bundle with Hulu. It also added 3.9 million subscribers to Hulu.

Disney's streaming strategy has long seemed muddled. Netflix, by comparison, has stated for years that it wants to provide a wide range of video entertainment options so it has something for everyone.

The value proposition with Disney's multiple options seems less clear. Owning Hulu outright gave Disney a chance to merge the two services together, making the customer experience simpler and meaning it only has to advertise and find programming for one service. The current bundle can feel clunky and unnecessary, and Disney seems poised to make a similar mistake with Fubo and Hulu + Live TV, keeping them as separate services rather than combining them.

Its streaming proposition could grow even messier when it launches ESPN to streaming as it seems poised to own at least four separate streaming services, bundled or not.

The recent slide in Disney subs might be a blip, but I'd like to see steadier growth from a segment that is supposed to represent the company's future.

2. It needs to keep leading the box office

The biggest bright spot in Disney's first-quarter report was its performance at the box office. It flipped a loss in its content sales/licensing business of $224 million to a profit of $312 million, largely due to the success of Moana 2 and Mufasa: The Lion King.

Tentpole franchise productions like Moana are the biggest key to Disney's flywheel business model. The success of those movies helps drive theme park visits, purchases of products like toys, and subscriptions for its streaming services.

Disney paid $71 billion for Fox's entertainment in 2019 and has struggled to get its money's worth. Cranking out box office hits with that intellectual property and others is the best way to make it pay off.

Theatrical releases also have a lot of leverage, as a hit can make a large profit, while a bust will lose money. Not every movie will be a hit, but Disney should be generating a solid profit from the content sales and licensing segment every quarter.

3. Can it remain the leader in sports?

It's a brave new world for ESPN. The company's dominance of the cable ecosystem has faded in the streaming era, and it now faces competition from tech giants, as well as traditional media companies.

Meanwhile, the price of sports content continues to go up due to the popularity of live sports and competition with the deep-pocketed tech giants.

The launch of the ESPN flagship service later this year will be a crucial test for the company. Not only does Disney need to attract a substantial audience to ESPN, but it also needs to be profitable and show that it can grow that profit. In order to do that, ESPN may need to get back its roots and connect with audiences through studio programming like SportsCenter in addition to live sports.

The future of Disney may hinge on ESPN more than anything else, as it's long been a prized cash cow for the company, and its decline has been a major reason for the stock's struggles over the last decade.

We won't have an answer to that for at least a few quarters after its launch, but its success is a key imperative for CEO Bob Iger, who is expected to retire next year.

Disney's guidance calls for high-single-digit earnings-per-share growth in the year, which is fine, but not enough to excite investors. If the company executes across all aspects of business, it could grow profits much faster than that. The potential is still there, but Disney needs to deliver in the three areas above to give shareholders the return they've been expecting.

According to a new research report from Fidelity, 2025 could be the year that central banks and sovereign governments around the world start buying Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). That's a significant change, given how much money might flow into Bitcoin.

In fact, the amount of money flowing into Bitcoin might even surpass the amount that has already arrived via the new spot Bitcoin ETFs. If that's the case, then Bitcoin might skyrocket in value. But just how likely is this scenario? Let's take a closer look.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

The strategic Bitcoin reserve

It's perhaps no surprise what led to this recent development of central banks and sovereign governments buying Bitcoin: a proposed plan by the U.S. government to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. While the U.S. government already ranks as the largest sovereign holder of Bitcoin in the world, there has never been any formal strategy in place to acquire crypto. The creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve would change that.

According to the BITCOIN Act of 2024, the U.S. could purchase as many as one million Bitcoins over a five-year period. That's equivalent to 5% of the total circulating supply of Bitcoin. That would, in essence, make the U.S. a Bitcoin juggernaut.

And there are even more aggressive estimates for how much Bitcoin the U.S. might buy. During the 2024 presidential election, then-candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. (currently nominated to be the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services) proposed that the U.S. should buy 550 Bitcoins every single day until it had amassed a total of 4 million Bitcoins. That scale of Bitcoin buying, of course, is completely unprecedented.

But just keep in mind: There is no clear template for the U.S. to follow, and nobody is really even sure if this strategic Bitcoin reserve will ever be created. Already, the Trump administration appears to be backing away from characterizing this as a "Bitcoin reserve," and is instead referring to it as a "national digital asset stockpile." That suggests other digital currencies might be added to the mix.

Central banks and sovereign governments buying Bitcoin

Where things get interesting is when you consider what potential impact the creation of this strategic Bitcoin reserve might have on other nations. If the United States -- the biggest economic superpower in the world -- is buying Bitcoin, then other nations might have to as well. Otherwise, they might be left behind. Fidelity refers to this as "political and economic game theory," but longtime crypto investors know what this really is: FOMO, or the fear of missing out.

Right now, the best example of a nation strategically buying significant amounts of Bitcoin is El Salvador. It officially made Bitcoin legal tender in 2021, and has been buying Bitcoin aggressively ever since. According to Fidelity, it currently holds 6,000 Bitcoins worth an estimated $600 million.

That might sound like a lot of Bitcoin, but a single U.S. company -- MicroStrategy -- holds much more than that. As of January 2025, MicroStrategy held 471,170 Bitcoins. And the U.S. government, simply as a result of asset forfeitures and seizures, holds 198,000 Bitcoins. If the U.S. moves forward with plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, it might buy 200,000 Bitcoins in a single year!

Keep your eye, too, on what's happening in Europe. In early February, the head of the Czech Republic's central bank suggested that it might start buying Bitcoin. The current proposal is to buy $7 billion worth of Bitcoin, which is equivalent to approximately 5% of the Czech National Bank's international reserves. If that plan moves forward, it could lead to other European nations buying Bitcoin.

Could Bitcoin double in value?

The suggestion that Bitcoin could double in value as a result of all this new buying by central banks and sovereign governments might sound, well, far-fetched. Fair enough. But consider what happened with the new spot Bitcoin ETFs, and what impact they had on the price of Bitcoin.

In just a single year, these spot Bitcoin ETFs accumulated approximately $100 billion in assets under management. If we assume a price of $100,000 for Bitcoin, that's equivalent to roughly 1 million Bitcoins. That 1 million Bitcoin figure should sound familiar -- that's exactly the same amount of Bitcoin that the U.S. government plans to buy for its strategic Bitcoin reserve.

And we all saw what happened when so much buying of Bitcoin occurred. As soon as the new spot Bitcoin ETFs launched, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed by 122%. Bitcoin literally doubled in price, from $44,000 in January 2024 to over $100,000 by December.

You can see where I'm going with this -- the trend of central banks and sovereign governments buying Bitcoin could be much bigger than anyone thinks. It quite literally could be a game changer for crypto. The rules of the global financial order would change, creating an entirely new game. The winner, of course, will be the nation that owns the most Bitcoin.

Intel's (NASDAQ: INTC) fourth-quarter results topped analysts' expectations but also showed a company that continues to struggle to find its footing. Its revenues once again declined, and it delayed an important chip launch. The stock is down more than 50% over the past year.

Let's take a closer look at the semiconductor company's Q4 results, and whether it can pull off a turnaround.

Revenue declines and foundry losses

For the third consecutive quarter, Intel saw its revenue decline. For Q4, revenue dropped 7% year over year to $14.3 billion while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) plunged 76% to $0.13.

Nonetheless, the results topped the analyst consensus calling for adjusted EPS of $0.12 on revenue of $13.8 billion.

Gross margin, meanwhile, fell by 650 basis points from 45.7% to 39.2%.

Intel's product segment saw revenue fall 6% to $13 billion. Within the segment, the client computing group's revenue declined by 9% to $8 billion. This unit is home to Intel's core personal computer CPU (central processing unit) business. It said it is on track to ship 100 million cumulative artificial intelligence (AI) PCs by the end of 2025, and that it will launch its new Panther Lake chip in the second half.

Intel's data center and AI unit, meanwhile, saw sales decline 3% to $3.4 billion, while its network and edge unit saw sales decline by 10% to $1.6 billion. The company is working on closing competitive gaps within the data center and has a number of upcoming data center CPU launches over the next two years to help in that regard. However, it is pushing back the expected launch of its important Clearwater Forest data center processor to the first half of 2026.

Overall, operating income for Intel's product segment fell 18% to $3.6 billion. Nearly $3.1 billion of that comes from CCG, which saw its operating income drop by 14%.

Intel's foundry segment, meanwhile, continued to struggle. Foundry revenue fell by 13% to $4.5 billion. The segment's operating loss expanded from $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion. It is looking to be breakeven in this segment by the end of 2027, helped by improved efficiencies and internal and EUV (extreme ultraviolet) wafers.

Client Computing Data center Network and edge Product segment Foundry segment Revenue $8 billion $3.4 billion $1.6 billion $13 billion $4.5 billion Revenue Growth -9% -3% -10% -6% -13%

The company generated $8.3 billion in operating cash flow during 2024, but it spent $23.9 billion in capital expenditures (capex) as it continues to build out its foundry operations. It ended the year with $50 billion in debt against $22.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. It also has $7.86 billion in grants from the U.S. Department of Commerce to build out its foundries in the U.S.

Looking ahead, Intel forecast first-quarter revenue to be between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, compared to revenue of $12.7 billion a year ago. It's looking for 36% gross margin, down 910 basis points year over year, and adjusted EPS of $0.00, compared to $0.18 last year. It plans to lower its 2025 capex to around $20 billion.

Intel plans to focus on monetizing non-core assets to help pay down debt. This includes selling a stake in Altera and potentially IPOing the unit down the road.

Can Intel's stock rebound?

Intel continues to be challenged. It still has a solid position in PCs, but it's struggled to make bigger inroads in the fast-growing data center market. The delay of its Clearwater Forest CPUs for data centers, which use its new 18A technology, is a big disappointment. This likely pushes back the chance of the company regaining data center CPU market share until at least next year. Meanwhile, the delay likely helps rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD), which has been taking share in data center CPUs.

Intel's foundry business remains a drag, as it continues to rack up losses and drain cash flow due to its heavy capex costs. However, these are real assets it is buying, and the unit is a hidden value within the company.

Turning to valuation, Intel trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 16 based on 2025 analyst estimates. However, its foundry losses obscure the lower valuation of Intel's underlying core business. In 2024, Intel's product segment generated $13.1 billion in operating income, which would equate to EPS of about $2.27 (assuming a 25% tax rate and 4.33 billion shares). As such, its core business is trading at about 8.6 times 2024 core EPS.

Meanwhile, in just the last three years, it has spent $74.5 billion in capex, mostly on its Foundry unit. If you subtract Intel's net debt from that, this unit can be valued at $10.50 per Intel share based on the value of its physical assets minus debt. Its stakes in Mobileye and Altera also have some value.

Thus, while Intel continues to have its fair share of struggles, I do think there's still some good hidden value with its share price at current levels that it may be able to unlock in the near future.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $336,677 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,109 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $546,804!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

<div> 出現。然後依據原文判斷這支股票SoundHound AI是否值得投資,說明原因,請以"建議:"開頭說明,不超過100字。

Son: 關鍵詞:股票分拆、人工智能、SoundHound AI、語音技術、高速成長

<br /><br />總結:
1. 2023年多家大公司進行股票分拆,包括沃爾瑪、Nvidia等
2. SoundHound AI是一家專注於語音AI技術的公司,為汽車、餐廳等行業提供服務
3. 公司收入持續高速增長,最近一季度收入增長89%達2500萬美元

建議:暫不建議投資。雖然公司在AI領域發展迅速且收入增長強勁,但尚未實現盈利,且股價已大幅上漲,存在較高風險。建議等待公司展現更明確的盈利能力後再考慮投資。 <div>
Last year was a big one for stock splits. Major companies from Walmart to Chipotle Mexican Grill launched such operations, and players in the market's hottest growth industry -- artificial intelligence (AI) -- got in on the movement too. Leading chipmaker Nvidia, networking giant Broadcom, and equipment maker Super Micro Computer each announced and completed stock splits last year after their prices soared.

And after each new stock split, investors' biggest question was: "Which market giant will be next to join this list?" Though these operations don't change anything fundamental about a stock or the company, they could be seen as a generally positive sign. (I'll talk more about that later.) For now, let's get to that investor question and consider if one of today's most explosive growth stories could be the next candidate for a stock split. I'm talking about SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN), a company that's reported double-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter and has seen its stock soar more than 800% over the past year. Let's take a closer look.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

SoundHound's voice AI technology

You may not have heard of SoundHound before, but you might have interacted with its products without even realizing it. The company is a voice AI specialist, serving customers in industries such as automotive, restaurants, and healthcare. SoundHound's voice products stand out from the crowd thanks to its technology that results in higher quality communication; it translates speech directly into meaning, passing by the common step of translating the speech into text.

The company has launched products in the areas of "smart ordering," vehicle intelligence, and employee assistance, just to name a few.

All of this has resulted in significant growth quarter after quarter. In the most recent period, SoundHound reported an 89% increase in revenue to $25 million and made progress expanding its business across industries. Five different industries each contributed 5% to 25% to revenue. Just a year earlier, 90% of revenue came from the automotive sector. SoundHound is in high growth mode, expanding its platforms and its reach across industries, and investing in its technology. So, it's not surprising the company isn't yet profitable, reporting a net loss on a generally accepted accunting principles (GAAP) basis of about $21 million in the quarter.

Now, let's consider the possibility of a stock split. Companies often split their stocks after a period of huge gains, and we can clearly say that SoundHound has seen its stock take off. The company has proven itself to be a popular choice among investors seeking future AI winners.

How a stock split works

A stock split, by offering more shares to current holders, brings down the price of each individual share, something that may be necessary if gains have led a stock to reach very high levels. For example, the level of about $1,000 a share may be a psychological barrier for some investors -- they might hesitate to buy a stock for this price even if the valuation looks OK.

Stock splits don't change anything fundamental about the company or the stock, so market value, the value of your holding if you already own the shares, and the stock's valuation remain the same. That's why a stock split on its own isn't a reason to buy or sell a stock. But a stock split could be viewed as generally positive as it can make a stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, and a company's move to split its stock could suggest management is optimistic about the future and the potential for the stock to keep on climbing.

As mentioned, SoundHound's stock has soared, but the price hasn't reached a level that makes it difficult to access. Today, it trades for about $15 a share. And a stock split won't lower the valuation, so it wouldn't actually make SoundHound cheaper for investors.

SoundHound hasn't split its stock in the past, meaning we don't have clues about whether the company is amenable to such operations or not. But I would say that right now, a stock split isn't really necessary for SoundHound. So I wouldn't expect this AI player to be the next company to launch a split even after the stock's enormous gains in recent times.

Equity markets performed well in January, as they often do, but as the dust settles on that early-year run, the strategy for long-term investors remains the same: Invest in companies that can perform well over long periods, whether or not they moved in tandem with the market in January. One month of strong (or poor) returns means little in the grand scheme of things.

To illustrate that point, let's discuss two stocks in the biotech industry that have moved in opposite directions so far this year: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) and Moderna (NASDAQ: MRNA). Here's why these two companies could both produce outsized returns to patient investors.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is starting the year strong. On Jan. 30, the company announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved Journavx, the first non-opioid oral pain signal inhibitor to earn the green light from regulators. Vertex's shares jumped on the news, and with good reason. Considering the devastation that opioids have caused in many communities in the U.S., a pain treatment that sidesteps the potential side effects of opioids fills a significant need.

Further, Vertex now has medicines approved across pain, sickle cell disease (SCD), transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT), and, of course, cystic fibrosis (CF), its core area of expertise. Vertex still generates most of its revenue from its CF franchise and still delivers excellent financial results. In the third quarter, the company's revenue increased by 12% year over year to $2.77 billion.

In the next two years, sales from Vertex's newer medicines, including Journavx, its next-gen CF therapy Alyftrek, and Casgevy, which treats SCD and TDT, should ramp up significantly and help improve its already strong sales growth. Further, Vertex will likely make plenty of clinical progress, too. The company's late-stage pipeline includes inaxaplin, a potential therapy for APOL-1 mediated kidney disease, and povetacicept, an investigational therapy for Iga nephropathy (a chronic kidney disease).

There are no approved treatments that target the underlying causes of both of these conditions. Vertex Pharmaceuticals has more candidates in early-stage studies. There is still plenty of upside left for Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which makes it a top biotech stock to buy this month and hold onto for a while.

2. Moderna

Moderna is a victim of its own success. The biotech was fairly unknown in 2019, but rose to prominence in 2020 when it successfully developed a vaccine for COVID-19, a project in which most other companies of any size failed. Moderna made a small fortune thanks to this achievement, but its financial results and share price have been moving in the wrong direction for the better part of three years as the pandemic receded. Still, there are good reasons to expect the company to deliver strong returns over the long run.

For one, Moderna demonstrated its innovative capabilities by quickly developing a COVID-19 vaccine when the world needed it most. The company's mRNA platform looks highly exciting, especially considering there are many infectious diseases for which there still aren't any vaccines, and those of the mRNA variety are faster to develop. That should grant Moderna an advantage as it seeks to create new products.

The company has already earned approval for another one, mRESVIA, a vaccine for the respiratory syncytial virus. It also produced positive phase 3 results for its combination coronavirus/flu vaccine. Moderna's potential candidate for the cytomegalovirus is currently in phase 3 studies, as is its investigational personalized cancer vaccine that delivered excellent results in phase 2 clinical trials.

This cancer vaccine, in combination with Merck's famous drug Keytruda, slashed the risk of recurrence or death in melanoma patients by 49% compared to Keytruda alone. Moderna has several other exciting candidates in phase 2 studies. Though the stock remains down, Moderna should record excellent pipeline and regulatory progress in the next few years, leading to stronger financial results. So, investors should strongly consider the stock this month while it is still struggling.

March ICE NY cocoa (CCH25) today is down -71 (-0.70%), and March ICE London cocoa #7 (CAH25) is down -69 (-0.862%).

Cocoa prices today added to this week's losses and fell to 2-month lows. Cocoa prices are under pressure this week on signs of slowing cocoa demand. Chocolate maker Hershey said Thursday that high cocoa prices are forcing the company to reformulate recipes by replacing cocoa with other ingredients. On Tuesday, major chocolate maker Mondelez International pointed to a potential slowdown in chocolate demand when CFO Zarmella said, "We are seeing signs, particularly in parts of the world like North America, where cocoa consumption is coming down."

Beneficial rain in West Africa has improved cocoa tree development and is weighing on cocoa prices. Farmers in the Ivory Coast and Ghana report that recent rain has benefited their crops and led to the re-flowering of cocoa trees.

Concern about slowing Ivory Coast cocoa exports is a supportive factor for cocoa prices. While government data Monday showed Ivory Coast farmers shipped 1.29 MMT of cocoa to ports so far this marketing year, up more than +22% from last year, the pace has narrowed from the 35% rise seen in December.

West African cocoa crop production concerns are bullish for prices. Forecaster Maxar Technologies said this year's seasonal Harmattan winds are the driest in six years, worsening crop conditions. Some Ivory Coast and Ghana cocoa farmers have reported that cocoa trees are beginning to suffer the effects of the seasonal dry and dusty Harmattan winds, with leaves turning yellow and the cherelles (cocoa pods) withering.

Concern that the global cocoa deficit could widen is bullish for prices. On January 24, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) said a survey of global cocoa stockpiles at the end of the 2023/24 season was at 1.041 MMT, down -36% y/y and lower than a previous estimate of 1.300 MMT. The survey signals that the ICO's 2023/24 global cocoa deficit estimate of -478,000 MT may be even more significant than initially projected.

Tight global cocoa inventories are also bullish for prices. ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports have been trending lower for the past 1-1/2 years and, on January 24, fell to a 21-year low of 1,263,493 bags.

Cocoa also has support after chocolate maker Hershey Co. recently said it sought CFTC approval to buy a large amount of cocoa through the ICE Futures Exchange due to tight global supplies. Bloomberg reported that Hershey wants to take a position allowing it to purchase more than 90,000 MT of cocoa on ICE Futures US. The purchase size is more than nine times what the exchange currently allows. The amount also exceeds a federal position limit of 4,900 contracts, or 49,000 MT, set by the CFTC. Global cocoa shortages are so significant that it is now cheaper to take delivery of supplies through the New York exchange than buying in the physical market.

On December 18, NY Cocoa posted an all-time nearest-futures high, and London Cocoa posted a 9-month nearest-futures high on the deterioration of the West African cocoa mid-crop outlook. Maxar Technologies warned that dry conditions in West Africa will hurt the early development of the mid-year cocoa crop harvested in April and that the arrival of the seasonal Harmattan winds could worsen the situation.

In a bullish factor, the International Cocoa Association (ICCO) on November 22 raised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit estimate to -478,000 MT from May's -462,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years. ICCO also cut its 2023/24 cocoa production estimate to 4.380 MMT from May's 4.461 MMT, down -13.1% y/y. ICCO projected a 2023/24 global cocoa stocks/grindings ratio of 27.0%, a 46-year low.

A bearish factor for cocoa is the concern that high prices are causing demand destruction for cocoa. On January 9, the European Cocoa Association reported that Q4 European cocoa grindings fell -5.3% y/y to 331,853 MT, the lowest in more than 4 years. Also, the Cocoa Association of Asia reported that Q4 Asian cocoa grindings fell -0.5% y/y to 210,111 MT, also the lowest in 4 years. In addition, the National Confectioners Association reported that Q4 North American cocoa bean grindings fell -1.2% y/y to 102,761 MT.

Stronger cocoa exports from Nigeria, the world's sixth-largest producer, are also bearish for prices. Nigeria's Dec cocoa exports rose +87% y/y to 46,696 MT.

On the negative side, the Ivory Coast regulator Le Conseil Cafe-Cacao on October 18 raised its Ivory Coast 2024/25 cocoa production estimate to a range of 2.1-2.2 MMT from a June forecast of 2.0 MMT.

Cocoa found support after Ghana's Cocoa Board (Cocobod) on August 20 cut its 2024/25 Ghana cocoa production estimate to 650,000 MT from a June forecast of 700,000 MT. Due to bad weather and crop disease, Ghana's 2023/24 coca harvest sank to a 23-year low of 425,000 MT. Ghana is the world's second-biggest cocoa producer.

關鍵詞: 糖價 供需失衡 巴西 印度 泰國

<br /><br />總結:
1. 今日糖價溫和下跌,主要受美元走強影響。Green Pool預測2025/26年度全球糖市將從赤字轉為盈餘。

2. 巴西雷亞爾兌美元升至2.75個月高位,抑制了出口意願,推動糖價上漲至7週高點。

3. 印度2024/25年度糖產量同比下降12.2%至1650萬噸,但已允許出口100萬噸。

4. 泰國預計2024/25年度糖產量將同比增長18%至1035萬噸,為全球第三大糖生產國。

5. 全球糖市前景顯示:ISO預測2024/25年度產量為1.793億噸,同比下降1.1%;USDA預測將創紀錄達1.866億噸,同比增長1.5%。整體供需趨向寬鬆。 <div>
March NY world sugar #11 (SBH25) today is down -0.13 (-0.66%), and March London ICE white sugar #5 (SWH25) is down -4.30 (-0.82%).

Sugar prices today are moderately lower, weighed down by a stronger dollar. Sugar also has some negative carryover from Wednesday when Green Pool Commodity Specialists projected the global sugar market will shift to a surplus of +2.7 MMT in the 2025/26 crop year, compared to a deficit of -3.7 MMT in 2024/25.

Strength in the Brazilian real (^USDBRL) over the past two weeks has spurred fund short-covering in sugar, with sugar prices climbing to a 7-week high Thursday. The real rose to a 2-3/4 month high against the dollar today and discourages export selling from Brazil's sugar producers.

Sugar has some carryover support from Tuesday when Centrum reported that India's 2024/25 sugar production from October 1 to January 31 was down -12.2% y/y to 16.5 MMT.

Sugar prices have been in a 4-month-long downtrend. On January 21, NY sugar posted a 5-1/2 month nearest-futures low, and London sugar posted a 3-1/2 year low. An improving global sugar supply outlook is weighing on sugar prices. On January 20, India said it would allow its sugar mills to export 1 MMT of sugar this season, easing its restrictions placed on sugar exports in 2023. India has restricted sugar exports since October 2023 to maintain adequate domestic supplies. India allowed mills to export only 6.1 MMT of sugar during the 2022/23 season to September 30 after allowing exports of a record 11.1 MMT in the previous season.

On November 21, the International Sugar Organization (ISO) reduced its 2024/25 global sugar deficit forecast to -2.51 MMT, compared to an August forecast of -3.58 MMT. ISO also raised its 2023/24 global sugar surplus estimate to 1.31 MMT from an August projection of 200,000 MT.

The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for sugar prices. On October 29, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board projected that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production would jump by +18% y/y to 10.35 MMT. Thailand produced 8.77 MMT of sugar in the 2023/24 season that ended in April. Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest sugar exporter.

Sugar found support last Wednesday after Czarnikow cut its Thailand 2024/25 sugar production estimate to 10.8 MMT from a previous forecast of 11.6 MMT.

Drought and excessive heat last year caused fires in Brazil that damaged sugar crops in Brazil's top sugar-producing state of Sao Paulo. Sugar cane industry group Orplana said that as many as 2,000 fire outbreaks affected up to 80,000 hectares of planted sugarcane in Sao Paulo. Green Pool Commodity Specialists noted that as much as 5 MMT of sugar cane may have been lost due to the fires. Conab, Brazil's government crop forecasting agency, cut its 2024/25 Brazil sugar production estimate from November 21 to 44 MMT from a previous forecast of 46 MMT, citing lower sugarcane yields due to drought and excessive heat. Unica reported today that cumulative 2024/25 Center-South sugar output through mid-January is down -5.5% y/y to 39.794 MMT.

Sugar has support from signs of smaller sugar production in India, the world's second-largest producer. The ISM projects India's 2024/25 sugar production to fall -15% y/y to a 5-year low of 27.27 MMT.

As a supportive factor for sugar prices, the ISO on August 30 forecasted 2024/25 global sugar production of 179.3 MMT, down -1.1% y/y from 181.3 MMT in 2023/24.

The USDA, in its bi-annual report released November 21, projected that global 2024/25 sugar production would climb +1.5% y/y to a record 186.619 MMT and that global 2024/25 human sugar consumption would increase +1.2% y/y to a record 179.63 MMT. The USDA also forecasted that 2024/25 global sugar ending stocks would decline -6.1% y/y to 45.427 MMT.

關鍵詞: Rivian、電動車、股票估值、銷量、新車型

<br /><br />總結:
1. Rivian股票雖然近期上漲30%,但仍具投資價值
2. 2024年Rivian銷量僅微增,特斯拉下跌1.1%,Lucid增長71%
3. Rivian計劃在2026年推出三款平價新車型(R2、R3、R3X),價格低於5萬美元
4. 從市銷率來看,Rivian的估值遠低於Lucid和特斯拉
5. 雖然需要耐心等待到2026年才能看到新一輪增長,但目前的股價相對便宜
6. 分析師認為長期來看Rivian仍有巨大增長潛力 <div>
If you've been monitoring Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) stock over the last few months, you may think your chance to buy has come and gone. Since hitting multi-month lows last November, shares have spiked in value by more than 30%. But the chart below proves why shares are still a screaming buy over the long term.

Rivian stock is cheap compared to Tesla and Lucid Group

Rivian had a tough 2024. Sales grew year over year, but just barely. The company shipped 51,579 vehicles in 2024 versus 49,476 in 2023. Deliveries are still headed in the right direction, but these are not the growth rates that investors have gotten used to in recent years. Fortunately, Rivian is not alone. Tesla saw sales fall by 1.1% in 2024, its first decline in nearly 15 years. Lucid Group, meanwhile, saw sales jump by 71%, reaching new records thanks to new model introductions.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

Looking beyond last year's results, Rivian has a promising future. In 2026, the EV maker plans to release three new mass-market vehicles: the R2, R3, and R3X. All should cost less than $50,000 -- a huge deal when it comes to tapping the largest section of the car-buying market. When Tesla introduced its affordable Model Y and Model 3 variants, sales growth picked up considerably. The same could be true for Rivian when its new models hit the streets.

You wouldn't know that Rivian has a bright few years ahead, judging by its price-to-sales ratio. Lucid Group trades at more than three times Rivian's valuation, while Tesla trades at more than five times its multiple. Lucid's premium valuation makes sense, given its high sales growth and diminutive size. But as you can see in the chart above, Rivian still has plenty of room to grow, even if its next leg of growth won't occur until 2026.

You'll need to remain patient for a year or two, but Rivian stock clearly isn't expensive if you can appreciate the likely sales ramp that will occur in 2026 and beyond.

<div> 。這5個關鍵詞要分別用雙直引號""括起來。

Investors certainly know Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS) as the media and entertainment powerhouse that owns popular cable networks including ABC, The Disney Channel, FX, and ESPN. The business also has a budding streaming division that is starting to report positive operating income.

But in fiscal 2024, 37% of the company's revenue came from the experiences segment, which encompasses Disney's theme parks, cruise ships, and consumer products. It's a key part of the flywheel that helps the brand connect with consumers across the globe.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

Management has announced a massive $60 billion investment, double the original plan, for the experiences division over the next decade. That's definitely a large sum of cash, but history says it's the right move that will pay off for the House of Mouse.

Bringing Disney's IP to the physical world

Disney's wide economic moat comes from its valuable intellectual property (IP), with its studios, franchises, and characters creating a treasure trove of content. The company's success is directly related to how it monetizes this IP. A lot of its money is made in movie theaters and on TV screens.

However, Disney's experiences segment brings this IP to life. The company owns two destinations in the U.S. and has a beneficial interest in four internationally. In total, it has 12 different theme parks. Seven of these are in the top 10 of the most popular by attendance. Combined, Disney sees 100 million visitors annually.

The company also rakes in revenue from its cruise ships and consumer products. Combined, this all makes up a very profitable segment, registering a superb 27% operating margin in fiscal 2024. That's better than entertainment and sports, the company's other two segments.

Doubling capex on experiences

Management wants to double capital expenditures to $60 billion over the next 10 years. That requires a huge cash outlay that will directly affect the company's ability to produce free cash flow.

Among the initiatives Disney plans are new attractions within the 1,000 acres of land that it hasn't yet developed across the world. A Pirates of the Caribbean Lounge is set to open this year, for example, with a Villains Land on the horizon later this decade. Expanding the cruise ship fleet is a huge priority. It just completed the Treasure, which set sail in November, with two new ships coming late in 2025. Between 2027 and 2031, four more ships will be built.

The cruise industry continues to see robust demand following the pandemic's disruptions. Disney not only wants to capitalize on this trend, but it also wants to use ships as a funnel to bring its IP to more fans. According to company research, there are 700 million people with "high Disney affinity" that have not visited a theme park, a huge untapped market opportunity.

This isn't the first Disney spending spree. At the start of the 2010s, the business directed more capital investments to parks and cruises. This resulted in much faster growth in operating income during that decade than in the previous decade. Executives aim to boost returns on invested capital, which will help its experiences segment create value for Disney.

Serving a larger customer base

This segment has historically been able to steadily raise prices, as evidenced by higher per-capita spending. That's certainly a wonderful quality to have.

There's a flip side to this, though. The last thing management wants to do is to keep raising prices to a point that they discourage families from visiting its theme parks or taking cruises. With that in mind, I believe the overarching goal is to expand capacity so that Disney can cater to more consumers. This can help increase the number of visitors instead of relying heavily on price hikes.

Investors should pay attention to commentary about specific investments being made and the returns that are achieved. Between fiscal 2014 and 2024, operating income for the experiences segment rose 132%. The hope is that Disney's planned $60 billion investment will result in that growth rate getting a boost.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $336,677 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,109 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $546,804!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

<title>Is Wall Street Bullish or Bearish on Ross Stores Stock?</title>
<link>https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-bullish-or-bearish-ross-stores-stock</link>

<div> 。

關鍵詞: Ross Stores、零售業、股價表現、財報、分析師評級

<br /><br />總結:
1. Ross Stores是美國主要折扣零售商,市值478億美元,主營Ross Dress for Less和dd's DISCOUNTS兩個品牌,提供比百貨公司低20-70%的商品價格。

2. 過去52週股價表現不如大盤,SPX上漲20.8%時ROST略有下跌,今年至今下跌6.1%。

3. Q3總銷售51億美元低於預期,但每股收益1.48美元優於預期,毛利率擴大70個基點至28.3%,公司上調全年每股收益預期至6.10-6.17美元。

4. 分析師預計2025財年每股收益同比增長11%至6.17美元,過去四個季度均超預期。

5. 21位分析師中14位給予"強力買入"評級,7位給予"持有"評級,目標價171.63美元,最高目標價190美元較目前股價有32.7%上漲空間。 <div>
With a market cap of $47.8 billion , Ross Stores, Inc. ( ROST ) is a leading off-price retailer in the U.S., operating Ross Dress for Less and dd's DISCOUNTS, which offer branded apparel, footwear, accessories, and home goods at 20% to 70% lower prices than department stores. Catering to middle- and moderate-income households, it focuses on providing quality fashion and home essentials at affordable prices.

Shares of the discount retailer have underperformed the broader market over the past 52 weeks. ROST has dipped marginally over this time frame, while the broader S&amp;P 500 Index ( $SPX ) has rallied 20.8% . In addition, shares of ROST are down 6.1% on a YTD basis, compared to SPX’s 2.6% gain.

Focusing more closely, the Dublin, California-based company has also lagged behind the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund’s ( XLY ) 27.5% return over the past 52 weeks.

Despite reporting weaker-than-expected Q3 total sales of $5.1 billion on Nov. 21, shares of ROST rose 2.2% the next day due to stronger-than-expected EPS of $1.48. Investors were encouraged by the company's 70-basis-point gross margin expansion to 28.3%, driven by lower freight and supply-chain costs, which helped offset softer sales. Additionally, Ross Stores raised its full-year EPS forecast to $6.10 - $6.17.

For the fiscal year, which ended in January 2025, analysts expect ROST’s EPS to grow nearly 11% year-over-year to $6.17. However, the company's earnings surprise history is promising. It topped the consensus estimates in the last four quarters.

Among the 21 analysts covering the stock, the consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” That’s based on 14 “Strong Buy” ratings and seven “Holds.”

This configuration is less bullish than three months ago, with 18 “Strong Buy” ratings on the stock.

On Nov. 23, 2024, Baird cut Ross Stores' price target to $175 but kept an “Outperform” rating, citing an EPS beat despite weather-related comp sales weakness. The firm noted improving trends and viewed the Q4 guidance as a sign of management’s confidence.

As of writing, ROST is trading below the mean price target of $171.63. The Street-high price target of $190 implies a potential upside of 32.7% from the current price levels.

Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) is probably the hottest stock on Wall Street. As of this writing, shares are up 51% year to date and more than 380% over the last 12 months.

So, where will Palantir shares be in one year? Let's dig into the numbers and see what's possible.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

A $260 billion market cap -- and counting

First things first, Palantir shares have been on an incredible ride.

Indeed, one year ago, I argued that "Palantir is a great company and a solid investment, [but] I don't think it has what it takes to cross the very high hurdle of $1 trillion by 2035."

When I wrote that, Palantir had a market capitalization of about $58 billion. As of this writing, it's over $260 billion -- and counting. That amounts to more than a fourfold return in less than one full year.

In other words, at that rate, Palantir would crack the $1 trillion mark in about one more year.

Needless to say, that seems overly optimistic, even for Palantir bulls like myself. Nevertheless, there's a reason why the company's stock has been skyrocketing: The company is on a path to something big.

Here's what it is.

Palantir could become the "Windows" of the AI revolution

Consider this: In the 1980s, personal computers were the great technological innovation. Almost everyone could see they were a big leap forward, but one question remained: Which operating system would emerge as the standard for the personal computer industry?

Apple had the Macintosh with its own proprietary operating system; many other companies offered their own systems with various bells and whistles.

Yet, one company ultimately came to dominate the space -- Microsoft, with its Windows operating system.

The lesson?

Artificial intelligence (AI) today could be analogous to personal computers in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the question is which company will develop the software that most elegantly harnesses the power of AI technology.

There will be plenty of winners. Sure, Microsoft won the first great battles in the personal computing wars, but others, like Apple, eventually recovered and delivered massive gains for its shareholders.

I believe Palantir could represent one of the first great AI software companies, a field which I expect to grow rapidly in the coming years. That's because AI -- along with robotics -- is poised to change the way organizations operate. Every aspect of operations, from logistics to customer service, even personnel management, can be improved with the aid of AI systems that will work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

As a result, expect more blowout earnings reports like the one Palantir just delivered.

For the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2024, the company reported:

A 43% growth in overall customers, year-over-year.

36% revenue growth from a year earlier, with 52% growth in the U.S. overall and 64% year-over-year growth in the U.S. commercial market

63% adjusted free cash flow margin.

In short, the company's financial metrics are surging, as you would expect from a leader within a cutting-edge field. Investors should pay attention. While Palantir's run thus far has been impressive, the stock could have legs for many years to come.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity

Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.

On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:

Nvidia: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, you’d have $336,677 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2009, !* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $43,109 !*

if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, !* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $546,804!*

Right now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.

關鍵詞: 比特幣 以太坊 ETF SEC Bitwise

<br /><br />總結:
1. SEC於1月30日加速批准了Bitwise Asset Management的比特幣和以太坊混合ETF申請的初步部分。

2. 這個消息公布後,現有的比特幣和以太坊ETF吸引了約6.55億美元的新資金流入,表明機構投資者看好這個混合ETF可能推高兩種加密貨幣的價格。

3. 這個新的混合ETF將根據市值進行權重配置,因此會更接近比特幣的表現而非以太坊,這讓投資者可以在保持比特幣保守特性的同時,利用以太坊當前的相對低估值。

4. 文章提醒投資者不要過分期待新ETF會帶來驚人改變。從歷史數據來看,單一的比特幣和以太坊ETF的推出並未對價格產生顯著影響。

5. 建議投資者可以考慮適度增加對這兩種加密貨幣的投資,如投資1000美元,但前提是計劃持有至少幾年,以充分受益於ETF及類似產品帶來的資金流入。

6. 這個混合ETF的推出可能會帶動更多類似產品面世,這可能會對價格形成支撐,但投資者不應因此過度投資或期待價格暴漲。 <div>
It's boom time in the cryptocurrency sector. Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) just picked up yet another reason that makes them worth a small investment of $1,000, even if you already hold some of each.

Here's what could happen and why it's worth investing ahead of time.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More »

These two major coins just got exposure to an interesting new catalyst

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Jan. 30 approved the initial part of an application by Bitwise Asset Management to issue a combined Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to Bloomberg. The approval was granted on an expedited basis, and now it is highly likely that the final go-ahead will come soon, at which point it will start trading on the market.

Upon the announcement, the existing set of ETFs that hold either Bitcoin or Ethereum saw inflows of roughly $655 million in new cash, suggesting that there are institutional investors who see the combined ETF as a possibility that could send prices of both assets higher. How much higher is unclear, but this is a (new) contribution to the investment thesis for both coins.

The fact that Bitwise's prospective ETF seeks to offer a blended exposure to both coins at once means that it won't perform precisely like anything else that investors with traditional financial accounts typically have access to. Notably, the fund is weighted by the market caps of Bitcoin and Ethereum, so it will perform a lot more like Bitcoin than Ethereum. That's useful, because it means investors would be able to buy an asset that could, over the next three to five years, capitalize on the relative undervalue of Ethereum at its current price point without sacrificing most of the generally conservative attributes of an investment in Bitcoin.

Keep your estimates grounded here

As exciting as it is to see that there's a new financial instrument which might further integrate Bitcoin and Ethereum into the traditional financial sector, thereby drawing more outside cash into both coins, investors need to understand that the new ETF probably won't be a game changer. Nor does it need to be for these assets to be worth buying and holding for the long haul.

Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs have existed separately for a while. Here's a chart of the gains of these two coins during the past three years, for reference:

Can you guess based on the chart alone when the ETFs for these two coins started trading after their approval?

If you said early January 2024 for the first Bitcoin ETFs and late July 2024 for the first Ethereum ETFs, you'd be right -- but you'd probably only get it right if you already knew the answer. Simply put, ETF approvals and the commencement of trading are not definitive catalysts for the coins. Just look at the price graph for Ethereum after July.

In the event that the blended Bitcoin-Ethereum ETF gains popularity with investors, expect other ETF combinations to launch, too, which could support higher prices as well.

Nonetheless, don't get a second mortgage to invest more in Bitcoin or Ethereum because you expect their prices to go to the moon once the new ETF starts trading. The chance of that happening is close to nil. Instead, consider that this is a positive event that makes it worthwhile to up your exposure by a more modest amount, like $1,000, provided that you're planning to retain your tokens for at least a couple of years to capture the full benefit of any inflows to the ETF or others like it.

Should you invest $1,000 in Ethereum right now?

Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $795,728!*

Dividends, Investments, PepsiCo, Chevron, Rexford Industrial Realty

<br /><br />Summary:
1. The article discusses three companies that consistently provide high-yielding dividends and recently increased their payouts: PepsiCo, Chevron, and Rexford Industrial Realty.

2. PepsiCo offers a 3.8% dividend yield and announced a 5% increase, marking its 53rd consecutive annual increase. The company generated $12.5 billion in net cash last year, easily covering its $7.2 billion dividend payments.

3. Chevron increased its dividend by 5%, reaching its 38th consecutive year of increases. With a 4.2% yield, the company produced $15 billion in free cash flow last year and expects to add $10 billion to annual free cash flow by 2026.

4. Rexford Industrial Realty raised its dividend by 3%, offering a 4.1% yield. The REIT has grown its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since 2013 and expects over 30% growth in net operating income over the next three years.

5. All three companies demonstrate strong financial positions and sustainable dividend growth potential, making them attractive options for investors seeking reliable passive income streams.

6. The companies maintain strong balance sheets and show potential for continued dividend growth, positioning them as excellent long-term investment choices for income-focused investors. <div>

Several high-yielding dividend stocks recently raised their payouts again. That list includes PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Rexford Industrial Realty (NYSE: REXR). With more dividend growth likely, this trio are great stocks to buy and hold for a steadily rising stream of passive income.

Satisfying investors' thirst for dividend income

PepsiCo currently offers a dividend yield of around 3.8%. That's more than three times higher than the S&amp;P 500's dividend yield (around 1.2%).

The beverage and snacking giant recently announced its latest annual dividend increase. The company intends to increase its dividend by 5%, starting with the June payment. That represents its 53rd consecutive annual dividend increase, keeping PepsiCo in the elite group of Dividend Kings (companies with 50 or more years of annual dividend growth).

PepsiCo can easily afford its high-yielding and steadily growing dividend. The company produced $12.5 billion in net cash last year, easily covering its $7.2 billion dividend outlay. PepsiCo also repurchased $1 billion of its shares. The company ended the year with a cash-rich balance sheet with over $9 billion of cash and short-term investments. With more growth ahead (it expects to deliver mid-single-digit earnings-per-share growth in 2025), PepsiCo is in a strong position to continue paying a growing dividend.

A well-oiled dividend-paying machine

Chevron recently announced a 5% dividend increase for 2025. That marks the oil giant's 38th consecutive year with an annual dividend increase. It has grown its payout at a faster pace than the S&amp;P 500 has over the past five years. That pace is nearly double the rate of its nearest peer in the oil patch. With its latest raise, Chevron's dividend yields 4.2%.

The oil giant is in an excellent position to continue increasing its dividend. It produced $15 billion in free cash flow last year, easily covering its $11.8 billion dividend outlay. Chevron returned a record $27 billion in cash to shareholders last year via dividends and share repurchases by utilizing its strong balance sheet. It ended the year with a net debt ratio of around 10%, well below its 20% to 25% target range.

Chevron expects to produce an even bigger free cash flow gusher in the future. It foresees adding $10 billion to its annual free cash flow by 2026, fueled by projects to grow its high-margin production and cost savings initiatives. That number doesn't include its pending acquisition of Hess, which would significantly enhance and extend its free cash flow growth outlook. It should give the oil giant plenty of fuel to continue increasing its payout.

Lots of built-in growth

Rexford Industrial Realty recently revealed that it's raising its dividend by another 3%. That pay bump pushed the industrial real estate investment trust's (REIT's) dividend yield up to around 4.1%.

On the one hand, Rexford's recent raise is a bit light compared to its historical growth rate. The REIT has grown its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since its initial public offering in 2013. It could certainly have supported a higher dividend increase, given its strong financial profile and the earnings growth it delivered last year (6.8% increase in its core funds from operations (FFO) per share).

Instead, the REIT opted to launch a $300 million share repurchase program to capitalize on the nearly 30% decline in its share price since the start of last year. The company's stock has slumped due to higher interest rates and slowing demand growth in the Southern California logistics market, its sole focus area.

Rexford Industrial has significant built-in growth that should help offset the near-term headwinds of the Southern California warehouse market. The company expects its net operating income to grow by more than 30% over the next three years, driven by repositioning and redevelopment projects and rental increases (embedded in its existing leases and capturing much higher market rates as legacy leases expire).

On top of that, the REIT has a strong balance sheet, giving it ample financial flexibility to make accretive acquisitions as opportunities arise. The REIT's built-in growth and additional upside from acquisitions and improving market conditions position it to continue increasing its dividend in the future.

High-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks

PepsiCo, Chevron, and Rexford Industrial Realty continue to grow their high-yielding dividends. They're all in strong positions to keep pushing their payouts higher in the future. Because of that, they're excellent dividend stocks for those seeking lucrative and growing income streams to buy.

Don’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity
